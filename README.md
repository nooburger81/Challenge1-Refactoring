# Optimizing Code to Meet Accessibility Standards

## Description

A marketing agency contracted us to refactor their source code to meet accessibility standards so their site is optimized for search engines. Alt text was added to images, the title of the page was changed to better explain the company in general, and links were repaired.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
